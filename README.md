# CYBER-SECURITY-BASED-ON-ENCRYPTION
Data security is very challenging issuethat touches many areas including computers and                    communication. Recently wecame across many attacks on cyber security that have played with theconfidentiality of the users these attacks just broke all the securityalgorithms and affected the confidentiality, authentication, integrity,availability and identification of user data. cryptography is one such way tomake sure that confidentiality, authentication, integrity, availability andidentification of user data can be maintained as well as security and privacyof data can be provided to the user. Encryption is the process of convertingnormal data or plaintext to something incomprehensible or cipher-text byapplying mathematical transformations or formulae these mathematicaltransformations or formulae used for encryption processes are calledalgorithms. we have analysed ten data encryption algorithms Triple Des ,Rsa, ,Blowfish, Twofish, Aes, are symmetric key cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we have analysed variousencryption algorithms on the basis of different parameters and compared them tochoose the best data encryption algorithm so that we can use it in our futurework.
